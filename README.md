HECKTOR2022
------------
This repository was not updated for the HECKTOR 2022 edition, since we do not provide bounding boxes anymore.
If you need some code to get started for the HECKTOR2022 Challenge you can take inspiration from the resampling code under src/resampling/resample_2022.py.
If you are stuck do not hesitate to post question on the challenge forum: https://grand-challenge.org/forums/forum/hecktor-656/

We also added two notebooks (dummy examples) to help explaining what we expect for the submission.
* Segmentation: notebooks/example_seg_submission2022.ipynb
* Survival: notebooks/example_surv_submission2022.ipynb

In the notebook notebooks/evaluate_segmentation2022.ipynb you will find the code we use for the evaluation of the segmentation task.

HECKTOR 2021 challenge WATCH OUT, this version is not updated yet for the 2022 edition
==============================

This repository gives an example on how to preprocess the data of the HECKTOR challenge. Any other preprocessing is welcomed and any framework can be used for the challenge, the only requirement is to submit the results in the same coordinate system as the original CT images (same spacing and same origin). This repository also contains the code used to prepare the data of the challenge (DICOM to NIFTI, SUV computation and bounding box generation, not needed for the participants). Moreover, it contains an example of implementation to resample the data within the bounding boxes and resample back to the original resolution.


Download Data
------------
To access the data, visit the challenge website: https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/miccai-2021-hecktor and follow the instructions.
The code included here was intended to work with a specific repository structure described in Section Project Organization.
Following `git clone https://github.com/voreille/hecktor.git`, create a `data/` folder in the repository and place the unzipped data in it.

Install Dependencies
------------
To install the necessary dependencies you can use `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It is advised to use it within
a python3 virtual environment.

Resample Data
------------
Run `python src/resampling/resample.py` to crop and resample the data following the repository structure or use arguments (type `python src/resamping/resample.py --help` for more informations).

Evaluation
------------
An example of how the segmentation (task 1) will be evaluated is illustrated in the notebook `notebooks/evaluate_segmentation.ipynb`. Note that the Hausdorff distance at 95 % implemented in https://github.com/deepmind/surface-distance will be used in the challenge (not the one found in `src/evaluation/scores.py`).

The concordance index used to evaluate task 2 and 3 is implemented in the function `concordance_index(event_times, predicted_scores, event_observed=None)` from the file `src/aicrowd_evaluator/survival_metrics.py`. It was adapted from https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/blob/master/lifelines/utils/concordance.py to account for missing predictions (missing predictions are handled as non-concordant).

Submission
------------
Dummy examples of correct submission for task 1 and 2 can be found in `notebooks/example_seg_submission.ipynb` and `notebooks/example_surv_submission.ipynb`respectively.
